### DESCRIPTION

Humans tend to be much more casual than computers when it comes to telling the time. The computers’ usual "22:15"-format requires a little extra processing as compared to the more familiar "quarter past ten".
fuzzytime attempts to remove this obstacle by telling you the time the way that a human would.
fuzzytime is neither the first nor the only program which can do this, but it hopes to get closer to the goal than others because the author is a linguist and expects that this should help him come up with localizations which do not sound like MS® Translator.


### INTENDED USE

The intended use for fuzzytimer is in an environment which does not provide a status bar with a built-in clock. It is expected to be piped to a status bar and run every minute or so in the clock mode.
The timer can be set via the timer-setting mode. When the timer is set, the clock mode will show how much time there is left till some event. To get back to showing the actual time, timer has to be unset.


### --help
